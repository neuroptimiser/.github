# NeuroOptimiser

**NeuroOptimiser** is an open research framework for the development of neuromorphic-inspired optimisation algorithms. It integrates spiking neural network models with heuristic search mechanisms to address complex, high-dimensional black-box optimisation problems.

## Key Features
* 🔬 Built on top of lava-nc, leveraging neuromorphic computation principles.
* ⚙️ Modular architecture for designing and extending neuromorphic heuristic models.
* 📊 Integrated evaluation tools for benchmarking and black-box optimisation tasks.
* 📄 Scientific reference: [Paper DOI — to be updated]
* 🌐 Full documentation: https://neuroptimiser.github.io/
